# Cube 3D project in JavaScript WebGL

This project showcases a 3D cube rendered using WebGL, with cel-shading for a cartoon-like appearance and texture mapping to add detailed surfaces. It's a basic example demonstrating shading techniques and texture usage.

## Features

- 3D cube rendered using WebGL.
- Cel-shading for a cartoon-like appearance.
- Texture mapping for detailed surface rendering.
- Vertex and fragment shaders implemented for shading and texturing.
- Simple cube rotation.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-cube-cel-shading.git
Open the project directory and serve it using a local server. You can use tools like http-server or live-server.

Access the project in your web browser using the local server's URL.

## How it Works?
The project uses WebGL to render the 3D cube and apply cel-shading and texture mapping effects.
The vertex and fragment shaders are responsible for applying cel-shading and texturing to the cube.
